protecting yourself against the imminent zombie attack
(A collection of things to do with JavaScript)

### install 
```
$ npm install
```

### SMTP
Settings should be saved in a file in the root directory called ```smtp-config.json``` that looks like:

```
{
	'username': 'foo@bar.com',
	'password': 's0m3th1ng' 
}
```

I realize this is not secure, but it is at least easy to implement for now.
